# Jukebox

This personal project is about creating a web frontend and some type of backend that will leverage the spotify API to get music.  THe idea being it will be simple to search for, find and add songs to a "playing no" playlist - like a jukebox.

Once created, I plan on running this on something like a Raspberry PI, with a touch screen and will build this into a physical box that my girls can have on their shelves.
